# connection-with-database

we have created 3 packages with class 
1 - package db outil with class DBconnection
2 - package main with class main  
3 - package application with class DbsTatement  


in class DBconnection create  methodes to establish the connection for example 
create the database for all thes tables and objetcs and where we save database
and connection String create 

in the DBstatement class we need a connection to the database and 
we need sql statement which sends the sql commands to the database 


and then check in the main class 


This is a model, but we can use it with oracle database or mysql......
